Personal sexy dotfiles, for you to love. (or star on Github)
========
As I am coming from the great Commodore 64 world, I tend to spend a lot of time on the command line (CLI). 
However this has always been a love and hate relationship. Throughout time my CLI love grew stronger as I 
found out how to achieve maximum productivity by adjusting hidden configuration files. All these files 
started with a dot. Hence the name dotfiles.

I keep my personal dotfiles collection here, as it enables me to easily sync and set-up different machines, 
Linux/Unix and OSx. (Mostly Mac OSx though.)

#Install
At the moment I make no use of an 'install shellscript' or something like that. I just 'git clone' this repo and
copy&paste files in position. I will add an install routine in the near future.
