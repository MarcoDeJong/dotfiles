Personal dotfiles
=================
As I am coming from the great Commodore 64 world, I tend to spend a lot of time on the command line (CLI). 
However this has always been a love and hate relationship. Throughout time my CLI love grew stronger as I 
found out how to achieve maximum productivity by adjusting (hidden) configuration files. All these files 
started with a dot. Hence the name dotfiles.

I keep my personal dotfiles collection here, as it enables me to easily sync and set-up different machines, 
Linux/Unix and OSx. (Mostly Mac OSx though.)

#Install Mac OSX defaults (.osx)
Some usefull system default will be installed by running this script only once. To install the Mac OSX 
default config file: run `bash .osx`. Your system will ask for your password. ENTER.
Just wait for the command to complete. Afterwards restart your system for all changes to take effect.

I would like to credit https://github.com/mathiasbynens/ for his .osx goodness
